# Impact of Covid-19 Lockdowns on Ether

An examination of the Spot and Futures prices of Ether (cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) during the onset of Covid-19 lockdowns in March 2020.

I use R to gather daily price data from FTX (an online cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency derivatives exchange) in order to create some basic visualisations. Data gathered using FTX's API. These visualisations can help us assess the impact that Covid-19 lockdowns had on the Spot and Futures prices of Ether in March 2020.
